This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ATG Frontend Interview Task

This app was build following a task from an employment interview given
during the JavaScript course at Chas Academy.

It was built in less than 8 hours and can probably be cleaned up a little
but I wanted to stick to finishing as soon as possible.

Please observe that minimal attention has been given to styling. Design is 
not my strong suit and styling was not part of the assignement.

## To run the application

Clone the repo. Run NPM install. Run npm start.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
